# Options

## Delay

The preview is rendered live with Ajax. Every time it needs to be updated it need to do a server request.

The delay is set to 2 seconds, but it can be changed.

```
c::set('plugin.reveal.delay', 2000 ); // Milliseconds
```

- If you care about your server, set a high value.
- If you care about speed, set a low value.
